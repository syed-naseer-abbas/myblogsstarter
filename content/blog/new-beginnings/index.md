description: Signaling in Core Network
---
Over the last few years or so, a major change for modern telecommunications networks has been the shift from a Vertically Integrated network model to a Horizontally integrated network model. This fundamental modification has significant implications for network signaling and consequentially for how this course is structured. There is a push to migrate all telecommunication networks to a horizontal layered model. The emergence of Core Network sees GSM moving into the horizontal layered model, this is very important to remember. All vendors have also introduced the monolithic architecture.
In essence; network implementations can be loosely classified as either Vertically Integrated or Horizontally Integrated.
